                Hi,  my names Allison but most people just call me Aly or Al if they don’t feel like saying an extra letter, currently I am a grand 20 years old. A kind of fun fact about me is that I’m a December baby as well as being born on the same day as the Winter Solstice, which in my opinion is pretty cool. I also used to have four Boston terriers, they were Ariel, Sadie, Clyde, and Chance. Currently we only have Ariel who is the oldest and the first one we got and Chance who is the offspring of Sadie and Clyde.  Both of them have their own distinct personalities, Ariel I swear has a princess complex from being the only dog for the first two years of her life but she’s also very affectionate and lovable. Chance is a certified goof ball and loves to play all day. However, as soon as it hits 9:30 he’s out like a light until he wakes up with me in the morning. Funny enough neither of us enjoy being up early in the morning but we don’t have much of a choice.
